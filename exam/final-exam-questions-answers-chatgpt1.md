# Answers to the questions

## Module 1

1. What is a service?
   A service is a self-contained unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely by other software components or applications. In the context of Service Computing, a service can be thought of as a piece of software that performs a specific function or task, and that can be accessed over the internet through standardized interfaces.

2. What is a web-service?
   A web-service is a type of service that is accessed over the internet through standardized protocols and interfaces. Web-services are designed to be platform-independent, meaning that they can be accessed by any application or software component, regardless of the programming language or operating system used.

3. What is a web-service protocol stack?
   A web-service protocol stack is a set of standardized protocols and interfaces that are used to enable communication between web-services and other software components or applications. The most commonly used web-service protocol stack is the SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) stack, which includes protocols such as XML, SOAP, WSDL (Web Services Description Language), and UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration).

4. What is XML messaging?
   XML (Extensible Markup Language) messaging is a method of exchanging structured data between web-services and other software components or applications. XML is a flexible, text-based format that can be easily parsed by computers, making it ideal for exchanging data between different systems and programming languages.

5. What is service description?
   A service description is a document or file that provides information about a web-service, including its functionality, interface, and input/output parameters. The most commonly used service description language is WSDL (Web Services Description Language), which allows web-services to be described in a standardized way that can be easily understood by other applications and software components.

6. What is service discovery?
   Service discovery is the process of finding available web-services on a network or over the internet. There are several methods of service discovery, including manual discovery (where services are listed in a directory or catalog), automatic discovery (where services are discovered using specialized software), and dynamic discovery (where services are discovered in real-time as they become available). The most commonly used method of service discovery is dynamic discovery, which is facilitated by protocols such as UDDI and WS-Discovery.

7. What is XML-RPC?
   XML-RPC (Extensible Markup Language Remote Procedure Call) is a protocol that uses XML to enable remote procedure calls between software applications over the internet. It is a lightweight protocol that allows applications to communicate with each other using simple XML messages.

8. What is SOAP?
   SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol that uses XML to enable communication between software applications over the internet. It is a more complex and feature-rich protocol than XML-RPC, and provides support for advanced features such as security and transaction processing.

9. What is WSDL?
   WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is an XML-based language that is used to describe web-services and their interfaces. It provides a standardized way for web-services to describe their functionality, input/output parameters, and communication protocols, making it easier for applications to discover and use web-services.

10. What is UDDI?
    UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) is a protocol that is used for service discovery and integration. It provides a standard way for web-services to register their services in a public directory, which can be used by other applications to discover and integrate with those services.

11. What is the relationship between XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP?
    XML is a markup language that is used to structure data, while XML-RPC and SOAP are protocols that use XML to enable communication between software applications. XML-RPC is a simple and lightweight protocol that uses XML to enable remote procedure calls, while SOAP is a more advanced protocol that provides support for advanced features such as security and transaction processing.

12. What is the relationship between SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI?
    SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI are all key components of the web-services architecture. SOAP is a protocol that provides a standard way for web-services to communicate with each other, while WSDL provides a standard way for web-services to describe their functionality and interfaces. UDDI provides a standard way for web-services to be discovered and integrated with other applications.

13. What is the relationship between WSDL and service description?
    WSDL is a service description language that is used to describe web-services and their interfaces. It provides a standardized way for web-services to describe their functionality, input/output parameters, and communication protocols, making it easier for applications to discover and use web-services.

14. What is the relationship between UDDI and service discovery?
    UDDI is a protocol that is used for service discovery and integration. It provides a standard way for web-services to register their services in a public directory, which can be used by other applications to discover and integrate with those services. Therefore, UDDI plays a crucial role in service discovery.

15. What are the three main actors in service architecture?
    The three main actors in service architecture are the service provider, the service requestor, and the service registry. The service provider provides the web-service, the service requestor consumes the web-service, and the service registry is used to discover the web-service.

16. What are the steps in a typical development plan for a service requestor?
    A typical development plan for a service requestor would involve the following steps:

    - Identify the business requirements for the service
    - Research and identify potential web-services that meet the requirements
    - Evaluate the web-services based on factors such as functionality, reliability, and cost
    - Develop a plan for integrating the chosen web-service into the application
    - Develop and test the code to consume the web-service
    - Deploy the application and ensure that it is working as expected

17. How do we develop web services from the service provider perspective?
    To develop web services from the service provider perspective, the following steps can be followed:

    - Identify the business requirements for the web-service
    - Design the interface of the web-service using WSDL
    - Implement the web-service using a programming language such as Java, .NET, or PHP
    - Test the web-service to ensure that it is functioning as expected
    - Deploy the web-service to a production environment

18. What data types are defined in XML-RPC specification and how are they represented?
    XML-RPC defines several data types, including integers, doubles, booleans, strings, and dates. These data types are represented using XML elements and attributes.

19. What elements are in XML-RPC request?
    The XML-RPC request consists of a method call, which is represented using the `<methodCall>` element. The method call contains the name of the method being called, along with any parameters that are passed to the method.

20. What elements are in XML-RPC response?
    The XML-RPC response consists of a method response, which is represented using the `<methodResponse>` element. The method response contains the return value of the method call, or an error message if the method call failed.

21. How developer uses XML-RPC?
    To use XML-RPC, a developer typically needs to write code that creates an XML-RPC request, sends the request to the web-service, receives the XML-RPC response, and then processes the response. This can be done using various programming languages and libraries, such as Python's xmlrpc.client library or Java's Apache XML-RPC library.

## Module 2

1. What is the relationship between XML, XML-RPC, and SOAP?
   XML is a markup language used to represent data in a structured format. XML-RPC and SOAP are protocols for exchanging data over the internet using XML. XML-RPC is a simpler protocol that allows for remote procedure calls using XML, while SOAP is a more complex protocol that supports features such as messaging, security, and transactions.

2. What is WSDL?
   WSDL stands for Web Services Description Language. It is an XML-based language used to describe the interface and behavior of a web-service. WSDL provides a standardized way of describing web-services so that they can be easily consumed by service requestors.

3. What is the relationship between WSDL and service description?
   WSDL is used to describe the interface and behavior of a web-service. It provides a standardized way of describing the service so that service requestors can understand how to interact with it. In this way, WSDL is used as a service description language.

4. What data does WSDL describe?
   WSDL describes the following aspects of a web-service:

   - The operations that the web-service supports
   - The input and output parameters for each operation
   - The message formats used to communicate with the web-service
   - The transport protocols and bindings used to send and receive messages

5. What is WSDL used for?
   WSDL is used to describe the interface and behavior of a web-service. It is used by service requestors to discover and understand how to interact with a web-service.

6. What are the major elements of WSDL?
   The major elements of WSDL include:

   - Types: Defines the data types used by the web-service
   - Message: Defines the format of the messages sent and received by the web-service
   - Port Type: Defines the operations that the web-service supports
   - Binding: Defines how the web-service is accessed over the network
   - Service: Defines the network address of the web-service

7. Can you identify abstract and concrete parts of an example WSDL document?
   Yes, an example WSDL document will typically have both abstract and concrete parts. The abstract parts include the port type, which defines the operations that the web-service supports, and the message, which defines the format of the messages exchanged between the service requestor and the service provider. The concrete parts include the binding, which defines how the web-service is accessed over the network, and the service, which defines the network address of the web-service.

8. Do you know what operations are available in this web service?
   Without knowing the specific web service in question, it is impossible to determine what operations are available.

9. What is the relationship between SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI?
   SOAP is a protocol for exchanging data over the internet using XML. WSDL is used to describe the interface and behavior of a web-service. UDDI is a registry for discovering web-services. SOAP messages are defined using WSDL, and UDDI can be used to discover the location of a web-service described in a WSDL document. Together, these technologies provide a standardized way of discovering, describing, and interacting with web-services.

## Module 3

1. What is service discovery?
   Service discovery is the process of finding and locating web services that are available on the internet. Service discovery is important because it allows service requestors to locate and use web services that meet their specific needs.

2. What is UDDI?
   UDDI stands for Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration. It is a platform-independent, XML-based registry for web services. UDDI allows service providers to publish their services and service requestors to discover those services.

3. What are the main uses of UDDI?
   The main uses of UDDI include:

   - Service publishing: Service providers can publish their services to the UDDI registry so that they can be discovered by service requestors.
   - Service discovery: Service requestors can search the UDDI registry to find services that meet their specific needs.
   - Service integration: UDDI provides a mechanism for integrating services from different providers into a single application or business process.

4. What is service composition?
   Service composition is the process of combining multiple web services into a single, integrated service. Service composition allows service requestors to create new, value-added services by combining existing web services in a meaningful way.

5. What is business process?
   A business process is a sequence of tasks or activities that are performed in order to achieve a specific business goal. Business processes are often complex and involve multiple systems and applications. Service composition can be used to automate and streamline business processes by integrating multiple web services into a single, cohesive process.

## Module 4

Sure, I can provide detailed answers to your questions related to web service programming:

1. What is Java EE?
   Java EE (Enterprise Edition), formerly known as J2EE, is a set of technologies and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for developing and deploying enterprise applications. Java EE provides a platform for building large-scale, distributed, and multi-tiered applications.

2. What is JAX-WS?
   JAX-WS (Java API for XML Web Services) is a set of APIs for building web services in Java. JAX-WS provides a standard way to develop and deploy web services using XML-based messaging protocols such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol).

## Module 5

1. What is a service oriented architecture?
   Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an architectural style for building distributed systems. In SOA, software systems are composed of loosely coupled, reusable, and interoperable components called services. Services can be combined together to create larger systems or applications.

2. What are services within SOA?
   Services within SOA are self-contained, modular components that perform specific functions. Services expose their functionality through well-defined interfaces, which can be invoked by other services or applications over a network.

3. What are the principles of service-orientation? Do you understand them in details?
   The principles of service-orientation include:

   - Standardized Service Contract
   - Service Loose Coupling
   - Service Abstraction
   - Service Reusability
   - Service Autonomy
   - Service Statelessness
   - Service Discoverability
   - Service Composability

   Each principle provides a guideline for designing and developing services that are interoperable, reusable, and maintainable.

4. How do Web services support service orientation principles?
   Web services support service orientation principles by providing a standardized way to expose and invoke services over a network. Web services use open standards such as XML, SOAP, and WSDL to define and describe services.

5. What are the benefits of SOA?
   Some of the benefits of SOA include:

   - Reusability of services
   - Interoperability between different systems and technologies
   - Scalability and flexibility
   - Reduced development costs
   - Improved agility and responsiveness to changing business requirements
   - Improved maintainability and manageability of systems

6. What are the pitfalls/challenges of adopting SOA? When not to use SOA?
   Some of the challenges of adopting SOA include:

   - Complexity of designing and developing services
   - Need for standardized service contracts and interfaces
   - Potential performance issues with network communication
   - Security and privacy concerns
   - Need for effective governance and management of services

   SOA may not be suitable for all types of systems or applications. For small-scale systems with simple requirements, SOA may be overkill and result in unnecessary complexity. Additionally, systems with highly specialized or proprietary functionality may not be suitable for integration with other systems using SOA principles.

## Module 6

1. What are three common SOA delivery strategies?

   The three common SOA delivery strategies are:

   1. Top-down: In this approach, the service-oriented architecture is designed first and the individual services are developed to fulfill the architecture. This approach is more aligned with traditional enterprise architecture processes and is best suited for large organizations with a clear understanding of their business processes.

   2. Bottom-up: In this approach, individual services are developed first and then combined into a service-oriented architecture. This approach is more agile and flexible, but it can be difficult to achieve consistency across services.

   3. Middle-out: In this approach, some services are developed first to address key business requirements, while the overall architecture is still being developed. This approach is a compromise between the top-down and bottom-up approaches and allows for more flexibility in the development process.

2. What are SOA delivery lifecycle phases?

   The SOA delivery lifecycle phases include:

   1. Service-oriented analysis: In this phase, business requirements are analyzed to identify potential services and the scope of the service-oriented architecture.

   2. Service-oriented design: In this phase, the services identified in the analysis phase are designed and the service-oriented architecture is created.

   3. Service-oriented development: In this phase, the services are developed and tested.

   4. Service-oriented deployment: In this phase, the services are deployed to the production environment.

   5. Service-oriented management: In this phase, the services are monitored, managed, and maintained.

3. What is the purpose of service-oriented analysis? What are the steps taken in this phase?

   The purpose of service-oriented analysis is to identify potential services and determine the scope of the service-oriented architecture. The steps taken in this phase are:

   1. Business process identification: In this step, the business processes are identified and analyzed to determine potential services.

   2. Service identification: In this step, the potential services are identified based on the business processes analyzed in the previous step.

   3. Service modeling: In this step, the services identified in the previous step are modeled using UML, BPMN, or other modeling languages.

   4. Service specification: In this step, the services are specified in detail, including the data they consume and produce, their interfaces, and their dependencies.

4. What happens in service-oriented design phase of an SOA delivery lifecycle?

   In the service-oriented design phase of an SOA delivery lifecycle, the services identified in the analysis phase are designed and the service-oriented architecture is created. The following activities take place in this phase:

   1. Service interface design: In this activity, the interfaces of the services are designed, including the methods and data types they will use.

   2. Service composition: In this activity, the services are composed into a service-oriented architecture, taking into account their dependencies and interactions.

   3. Service choreography: In this activity, the interactions between services are defined, including the sequencing of messages and the data exchanged.

   4. Service orchestration: In this activity, the services are orchestrated to create business processes that automate specific business functions.

5. What choices are made during service development?

   During service development, the following choices are made:

   1. Implementation language: The language in which the service will be implemented, such as Java, C#, or Python.

   2. Data formats: The format in which data will be exchanged between services, such as XML or JSON.

   3. Transport protocols: The protocol used to transport messages between services, such as HTTP or SOAP.

   4. Security mechanisms: The security mechanisms used to protect the service, such as SSL or OAuth.

   5. Quality of service: The level of service provided by the service, such as availability, reliability, and scalability.

6. Why do we apply service orientation in both, service analysis and design phases?

   Service orientation is a key aspect of service computing and a fundamental principle of SOA. Service orientation promotes the development of loosely coupled, reusable, and interoperable software components called services that can be composed to form complex systems.

   In the service-oriented analysis phase of an SOA delivery lifecycle, service orientation principles are applied to identify, model, and analyze business processes and requirements in terms of services. This helps to identify and prioritize candidate services that can be implemented to satisfy the identified business needs. Service orientation principles are also applied to evaluate the identified services in terms of their suitability, completeness, and reusability.

   In the service-oriented design phase, service orientation principles are applied to design the detailed specifications of services that will be developed. This involves defining the service contract, identifying the service behavior, and designing the service implementation. Service orientation principles are also applied to evaluate the designed services in terms of their consistency, compatibility, and flexibility.

   Overall, the application of service orientation in both the service analysis and design phases of an SOA delivery lifecycle helps to ensure that the developed services are aligned with the business needs, are reusable, and can be effectively composed to form complex systems.

7. We have performed some steps of SOA analysis and design for one particular case - make sure to review the ppt slides from the lectures where we described this process in details and explained how and why these decisions were made

   - Are you able to perform the service analysis steps for the example scenario?
   - Do you know how to perform each step when refining ? How to apply the service orientation principles? How to make the adjustments?
   - Do you know how to apply reusability and autonomy principles to adjust the service candidates in our initial design?
   - Are you able to perform the service design steps for the example scenario?

   However, based on the general knowledge of service computing and service-oriented architecture, I can provide some information that may help answer your questions.

   - Service analysis steps:
     Service analysis is the first phase in the SOA delivery lifecycle, where we identify the business requirements and define the scope of the service system. The steps involved in service analysis include:
     - Identifying the business process and requirements
     - Defining the service scope and boundaries
     - Creating a conceptual model of the service system
     - Identifying the service candidates and their requirements
     - Analyzing the service candidates to determine their suitability

   To perform these steps, you would need to have a clear understanding of the business process and requirements, and use service-orientation principles to identify the service candidates that best fit the requirements. Reusability and autonomy principles can be used to adjust the service candidates in the initial design.

   - Service design steps:
     Service design is the second phase in the SOA delivery lifecycle, where we design the service interfaces and specify the service behavior. The steps involved in service design include:
     - Defining the service interface and behavior
     - Specifying the service contracts
     - Designing the service architecture and components
     - Developing the service logic and implementing the service components
     - Testing and validating the service

   To perform these steps, you would need to have a clear understanding of the service requirements and use service-orientation principles to design the service interfaces and specify the service behavior. You would also need to design the service architecture and components, develop the service logic and implement the service components, and test and validate the service to ensure that it meets the requirements.

   Overall, the process of service analysis and design requires a thorough understanding of service computing principles, business requirements, and software development methodologies. By applying service-orientation principles throughout the analysis and design phases, we can create service systems that are flexible, reusable, and scalable.

## Module 7

1. Cloud Computing

   Cloud computing is a model for delivering on-demand computing resources over the internet. It provides access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort. The following are the main topics covered in Module 7 related to cloud computing:

2. Cloud Service Models

   There are three main cloud service models:

   1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): This provides access to computing infrastructure, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking resources.

   2. Platform as a Service (PaaS): This provides a platform on top of which developers can build and deploy their applications, without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.

   3. Software as a Service (SaaS): This provides access to software applications over the internet, which are hosted and managed by a third-party provider.

3. Cloud Deployment Models

   There are four main cloud deployment models:

   1. Public cloud: The resources are made available over the public internet, and are owned and operated by a third-party provider.

   2. Private cloud: The resources are dedicated to a single organization, and are hosted either on-premise or in a third-party data center.

   3. Hybrid cloud: A combination of public and private clouds that are connected to each other, and allow workloads to move between them.

   4. Multi-cloud: The use of multiple public clouds from different providers, or a combination of public and private clouds.

4. Cloud Standards and Laws

   There are several cloud-related standards and laws that govern how cloud services are designed, deployed, and managed. These include:

   1. Service Level Agreements (SLAs): These define the terms and conditions of the cloud service, including availability, performance, and support.

   2. Cloud Security: There are several security standards and certifications that cloud providers can adhere to, such as ISO 27001 and SOC 2.

   3. Data Protection: Depending on the location of the data and the type of data being stored, there may be different laws and regulations that need to be followed.

5. Virtualization

   Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as an operating system, a server, a storage device, or a network. Virtualization is a key technology that enables cloud computing, as it allows multiple virtual machines to run on a single physical machine, and enables the rapid provisioning and scaling of resources. Some of the popular virtualization technologies include VMware, Hyper-V, and KVM.
