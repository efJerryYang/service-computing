## Course Review

### Module 1

- Introduction to service computing: concept of "service-oriented", background of service computing; XML-RPC: basics of XML_RPC technology

**Service computing** is a computing paradigm that uses services as the main components to develop applications.

**SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture)** is a design approach that uses services as the building blocks for creating distributed systems. It is an architectural pattern that enables the creation of loosely-coupled, reusable, and interoperable software services. It is not just a design pattern, but a broader concept that encompasses various technologies and methodologies used for creating and managing services. JEE does include APIs and technologies for building SOA-based applications, but SOA is not included as a package in JEE.

**Background of service computing**: the evolution of service computing from traditional distributed systems.

**XML-RPC** is a remote procedure call (RPC) protocol that uses XML to encode its calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism.

### Module 2

1. Service Message Exchange SOAP: basic components of the SOAP protocol, common programming languages to support SOAP;
2. Service description on WSDL: basic concepts of WSDL, generating WSDL, using WSDL to provide Web services

**SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)** is an XML-based messaging protocol used to exchange structured information between distributed applications over the web. The basic components of the SOAP protocol and common programming languages to support SOAP are discussed. While it can use different data formats such as XML, it defines a specific format for the message structure and how it should be processed by the sender and receiver.

**Basic components of the SOAP protocol**: envelope, header, and body.

**Common programming languages to support SOAP**: Java, .NET, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

**WSDL (Web Service Description Language)** is an XML-based language used to describe web services functionalities and their interfaces. The module covers the basic concepts of WSDL, generating WSDL, and using WSDL to provide web services.

**How to generate WSDL**: using a WSDL editor or generating it programmatically from a service.

**How to use WSDL to provide web services**: publishing the WSDL file and using it to generate client-side code.

### Module 3

1. Service Publishing and discovery UDDI: basic concepts of UDDI, UDDI structure, using common programming languages
2. Service composition: basic concepts of service composition, using BPEL to express a service composition

**UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration)** is a platform-independent, XML-based registry for businesses to list their web services.

**Basic concepts of UDDI**: white pages, yellow pages, and green pages.

**UDDI structure**: a hierarchical structure with nodes for business entities, services, and bindings.

**Using common programming languages with UDDI**: Java, .NET, and PHP.

**Service composition** is the process of combining two or more services to create a more complex service.

**BPEL**: It stands for Business Process Execution Language. It is used to model business process workflows and orchestrate web services.

Using BPEL (Business Process Execution Language) to express a service composition.

### Module 4

- Basic of web service programming; developing web services with JEE platform

**Web service programming**: the process of developing web services, which are software components that expose their functionality over the web.

**JEE** stands for Java Enterprise Edition. It provides a set of technologies and APIs for building web and enterprise applications. It is a superset of the Java Standard Edition (Java SE) and provides additional features for enterprise applications such as distributed computing and web services.

### Module 5

- Service Oriented Architecture: architectural patterns and modelling methods of SOA, designing a distributed service system with SOA

**Service-oriented architecture (SOA)**: a design approach that uses services as the building blocks for creating distributed systems. The architectural patterns and modeling methods of SOA are discussed, along with designing a distributed service system with SOA.

**Architectural patterns of SOA**: layered architecture, event-driven architecture, and service-oriented integration.

**Modeling methods of SOA**: service-oriented modeling and architecture (SOMA) and service-oriented analysis and design (SOAD).

**Designing a distributed service system with SOA**: identifying services, defining service contracts, and designing service components.

### Module 6

- Service engineering: life cycle of service systems, service engineering methodologies, design and development of the service system life cycle applied to the real service system

**Service engineering**: the process of designing, developing, testing, deploying, and managing service systems.

**Life cycle of service systems**: service identification, service specification, service development, service testing, service deployment, and service management.

**Service engineering methodologies**: top-down and bottom-up approaches, agile service development, and model-driven service engineering.

**Design and development of the service system life cycle applied to a real service system**: case studies and practical examples.

### Module 7

- Hot topics in Service Computing - Cloud Computing

**Cloud computing**: a computing paradigm that uses a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data.

**Hot topics in Service Computing related to cloud computing**: cloud-based service-oriented architecture, cloud-based service composition, and cloud-based service engineering.
