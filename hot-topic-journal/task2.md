## Benefits of Service Orientation in IoT

### Reduced complexity

<!-- The utilization of IoT systems has led to the need for reduced complexity. These IoT systems tend to become incredibly complex rapidly, especially when dealing with numerous devices, data sources, and protocols. In this regard, service orientation is a logical approach for dismantling this complexity by breaking down the system's functionality into smaller, more manageable components. By using a service-oriented architecture, the design, implementation, and maintenance of the IoT system become less intimidating, achievable, and practical. This reduced complexity benefit is valuable as it paves the way for a seamless and efficient IoT system. -->

Service Orientation in IoT is a logical approach to break down system functionality into smaller, more manageable components. In IoT systems, as the number of devices, protocols, and data sources increases, the complexity of the system grows exponentially, making it challenging to work with it. By integrating Service Orientation, system functionality can be divided into smaller, reusable parts or microservices. By separating IoT functionality into distinct components, Service Orientation can simplify the design, implementation, and maintenance of applications. Combining Service Orientation with Edge Computing, the latency and bandwidth issues can be resolved with smart, distributed computing, routing tasks, data storage, analytics, and standardization, saving resources and enhancing privacy.

<!-- For instance, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) research field is a crucial offshoot of IoT with an objective to link all types of industrial equipment with data acquisition, exchange and analysis systems to optimize processes and improve productivity while reducing costs. Incorporating edge computing in IIoT can significantly reduce decision-making latency, save bandwidth resources, and protect privacy.

### Improved security

<!-- Incorporating service orientation into IoT systems also enhances security. IoT devices are prone to cyber-attacks because of their connectivity and constant data communication, which makes them more susceptible. However, by using service-oriented architecture, security measures such as encryption, authorization, and data integrity checks can be embedded within individual services. This can add an extra layer of protection against malicious attacks on the system, thus providing a crucial boost to the security profile of any IoT solution. Enhanced security measures are crucial in ensuring that information contained within IoT systems is kept confidential, secure, and privacy-enhancing. -->

Incorporating Service Orientation in IoT systems enhances the security of the network. IoT devices are vulnerable to cyber-attacks because of their constant connectivity and communication of a vast amount of data. However, Service-Oriented Architecture enables the embedding of security measures such as encryption, authorization, and data integrity checks into individual services, providing an extra layer of protection against intrusion of the system. It is thus essential to integrate security measures into individual services within the IoT system, enhancing the overall security parameters of the system. Improved security measures are vital in ensuring information confidentiality, privacy, and maintaining system integrity.

<!-- A good example of improved security in IoT systems through service orientation is in healthcare. A healthcare institution could have an IoT system that monitors patients through connected devices. The system could be designed with security measures that are embedded within services, such as encryption to ensure patient privacy, customer authentication to prevent unauthorized access, and data integrity checks to prevent tampering of health data. By incorporating these security measures into individual services within the system, the overall security of the IoT solution is greatly enhanced, keeping patient information confidential and secure. -->
